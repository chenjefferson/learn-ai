A Mathematician's Lament - Paul Lockhart, Columbia Math PhD ex. Brown professor and K-12 teacher

Children not allowed to listen or play music until they spend a decade mastering notation and theory and transposing sheet music, art students aren't allowed to paint until studying colors and applicators and entering college.

This is how math is taught. Students spend years memorizing "fundamentals" that should pay off later.

It's not too helpful, especially for deep learning.

We should:

1. teach "the whole game"
  - which is beneficial for intrinsic motivation
2. through examples that are understood intuitively
3. simplifying as much as possible
4. while removing barriers
  - you can get state-of-the-art accuracy in 30 mins
  - huge datasets and resources only necessary sometimes

You should be able to make mistakes and leverage existing resources.
